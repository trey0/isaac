- `isaac_phase1x_panos.csv`: Summary of ISAAC Phase 1X panorama data selected to include in the first panoramic tour. The `/testsessions` path used here can be found at `hivemind.ndc.nasa.gov:/home/p-astrobee/webdir/testsessions` (or corresponding web URLs). Used by `scripts/collect_pano_inputs.py`.
- `isaac_phase1xx_panos.csv`: Same, but for ISAAC Phase 1XX panoramas. (Phase 1XX includes ISS activities ISAAC12-16.) So far, this is a list of all available panoramas, rather than the ones manually selected as best.
